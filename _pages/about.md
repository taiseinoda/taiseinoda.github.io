[Cannibalization and Scope Economies within Fund Families: The Impact of Passive Investing on Active Fund Fees](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3wi2njy8vkb0r5ojkf6nk/mf_demand_writing_20241007.pdf?rlkey=eir4uaf9lspbsrtlg5r5fkly1&st=l8g7tt14&dl=0)

**Abstract**

 This paper analyzes how the rise of passive funds, such as index funds and ETFs, affects price
competition in the mutual fund industry using structural demand estimation. Modeling mutual fund
companies as multi-product producers, it considers strategic pricing and cost synergies from managing
both fund types. Results show that multi-product families set higher fees by internalizing competition
within the family, raising fees by 1â€“2 basis points, but cost synergies reduce fees by 35 basis points for
active funds and 5 for passive funds.
