### Job Market Paper

[Cannibalization and Scope Economies within Fund Families: The Impact of Passive Investing on Active Fund Fees](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dlk9gc5bw2nphrhinrpwn/mf_demand_writing.pdf?rlkey=hn1g93sdk6iz6amk0s6grkd4t&st=5rx291qx&dl=0)

**Abstract**

This paper examines how the rise of passive funds, such as index funds and ETFs,
impacts price competition in the mutual fund industry through structural demand and
supply estimation. Modeling mutual fund companies as multi-product producers offer-
ing active and passive funds, the analysis incorporates strategic pricing and economies
of scale and scope. Results indicate that multi-product families raise fees by 1 to 1.5
basis points through competition internalization, while scope economies lower fees by
4.2 basis points for active funds and 27 for passive funds. A counterfactual merger
analysis reveals price increases from market power outweigh cost-efficiency benefits.
