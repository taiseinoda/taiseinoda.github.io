[Cannibalization and Scope Economies within Fund Families: The Impact of Passive Investing on Active Fund Fees](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/dlk9gc5bw2nphrhinrpwn/mf_demand_writing.pdf?rlkey=hn1g93sdk6iz6amk0s6grkd4t&st=5rx291qx&dl=0)

**Abstract**

This paper examines how the rise of passive funds, such as index funds and ETFs, im-
pacts price competition in the mutual fund industry using structural demand and sup-
ply estimation. Modeling mutual fund companies as multi-product producers—offering
both active and passive funds—it incorporates strategic pricing and scale and scope
economies. Results show that multi-product families raise fees by 1 to 1.5 basis points
by internalizing competition, while scope economies reduce fees by 4.2 basis points for
active funds and 27 basis points for passive funds. These findings highlight the nuanced
effects of multi-product pricing on equilibrium fees.
